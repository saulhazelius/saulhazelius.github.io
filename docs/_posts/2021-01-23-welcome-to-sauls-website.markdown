Thanks for visiting my personal website. It covers posts about ML (Machine Learning) stuff related to RecSys (Recommendation Systems) models and applications and AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) reflections. Both areas are fascinating and challenging. RecSys has decades of tradition and it is a very comprehensive field involving different approaches depending strongly on the practical context. AGI is derivated from AI and from the different notions of intelligence subjected to unavoidably philosophical discussions. But, as the meme below shows, at some point, everybody starts to think 'deeply' until they try to substantiate their conceived ideas.

My case is not an exception given that i am neither an AGI expert nor a Recsys expert. So, feel free to give any feedback about the information found here.
