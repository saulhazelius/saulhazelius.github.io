When somebody has been involved into the AI study field, sooner or later the AGI concept gets into the scene. Unavoidly, the question if a machine can achieve
 a human similar intelligence turns to be fascinating and intriguing.  This is deu to problems related with intlegiience and human mind that postivism, neuro,
 can not solve, like language consiousness, experience and so on. Thus the philosopher lying in everybodys emerges.

Thus, as the AGI term gets into consideratio
n, of course that philosophy of different things also gets into account, not only in the AGI but into all of the conceivable knowledge. In this particular cas
e, into knowledge that , again, tries to explain AGI intelligence with human intelilligence from different pioints of views, neuro, psico, to return to the co
nsiousness problem. This is related with the object theory, that is, in every study field, the object of study is created for further validation from other cr
eated objects. This is well knownw in the paradigms of science, that consider objects of study that works for another expected objects created wihtin the same
 framwork. In the aGI comparison tih human, the example would be this. Firstly , a neuro or psico pov consider some concept, then it is tested and observed, a
nd validated with another neruo or psico object. The human agi then is not different from this method, it simply translates working causes of humans to the ma
chinme. This results in the trends of neurosymbolic, dopamine, embodied, multiagent, etc. Now, an important point that remains to turing test ---and of course
 there are trends saying that this test is old, thus creating new objects for validate an aGi-- is that undesrtanding is not considered as complete. id like t
o mention an imporant phenomenology and ontologic work that explains this as a lack of world. Fjolland, indeed, it is a reemergence of dreyfus thoughts. Perso
nally i tested gpt3 with the rehotical questuion of the capitat cities and it got wrong. Now if a machine imitates, and a human also imitates, then of course
that the machine is intelligent.
The second important notion is this:  due to the anthropocentric vision of a machine, those intriguing question are comparable with the eternal questions about mind and consiousness,
not to mention the intelligence definition, that gets as a childish term against the consiousness concept deal.]] But, what is a machine is not anthropocentric but self organized individual? Important to mention, there are also trends on non anthropic ai.
More on that later
