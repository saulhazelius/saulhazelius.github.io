I'm a Data Scientist working in a home rental company. I'm also finishing py phD at the Computational Chemistry lab at Cinvestav-MÃ©rida, Mexico. My research area is the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning architectures to Molecular Structure Elucidation. Part of my thesis work can be found here: [JCIM](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00293), [LatinXChem-Conf](https://www.morressier.com/article/neural-architecture-molecular-elucidation-via-mass-spectrometry/5f6c5f439b74b699bf390c1f). I am interested in Cheminformatics, Recommendation Systems, and Artificial General Intelligence from a philosophical point of view.
