I'm a Data Scientist working in a home rental company. I'm also finishing my phD at the Computational Chemistry lab at Cinvestav-MÃ©rida, Mexico. My research area is the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning architectures for Molecular Structure Elucidation. I am interested in Cheminformatics, Recommendation Systems, and Artificial General Intelligence from a philosophical point of view.
